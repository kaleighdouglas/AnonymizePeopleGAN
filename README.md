## data_preprocessing
This directory contains code that pre-processes the CityScapes dataset into the format required by the PS-GAN code. (For a detailed explanation, see README within the data_preprocessing directory.)


## PS-GAN
The PS-GAN code was originally taken from the github repo: https://github.com/yueruchen/Pedestrian-Synthesis-GAN  
This code corresponds to the paper: Pedestrian-Synthesis-GAN: Generating Pedestrian Data in Real Scene and Beyond  
**Note: Several changes to their original code have been made.**
