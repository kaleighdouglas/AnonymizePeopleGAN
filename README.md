## Project Folder Structure

There are the following folders in the structure:

1) [`A-GAN`](./A-GAN): Folder with code for generating images (adapted from pix2pix code)
1) [`data_preprocessing`](./data_preprocessing): Folder with code for pre-processing the CityScapes dataset into the required format
1) [`anonymity-metric-deep-person-reid`](./anonymity-metric-deep-person-reid): Folder with torchreid library for person re-identification and additional code for evaluating anonymity of generated people
1) ...
